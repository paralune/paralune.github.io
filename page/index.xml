      <description>About the Game Mythic Ocean is a single-player, first-person, underwater exploration game set in an otherworldly ocean. The idea for the game came from our mutual fascination with the sea - our love for its gentle beauty, and our fear of its darkest depths.
You&amp;rsquo;ll meet many strange creatures, and what you say to them will have a big impact on how they feel about you and each other. The mystery of where this world came from - and where it&amp;rsquo;s headed - will become clearer as you form bonds with its inhabitants and help them grow.</description>

      <description>Paralune is a 3-person game studio in Austin, TX, founded in 2016 with the purpose of creating emotional stories with deep interactivity.
Exploring the thoughts and feelings of the characters in our games is our focus, and players will be asked to make choices that have real consequences. Our players are storytellers, too.
Our first title is currently unannounced and in development, so follow us on social media to get regular updates.</description>
