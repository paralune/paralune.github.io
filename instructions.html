					<ol>
						<li>Enter the password and download the .zip file</li>
						<li>Once it's finished downloading, unzip it</li>
						<li>Run the .exe inside the zip file</li>
						<li>You might see a window that prompts you to install "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Runtime". This is expected. If this pops up, hit "Yes" and let the UE4 prerequisite installer finish, and then re-launch the game.</li>
					</ol>
					<h1 class="summary-text">Tips and troubleshooting:</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Your virus scanner may warn you about the game since it's an .exe from an unknown source, and may try to prevent you from running it. If this happens you may need to tell it to ignore the .exe, or specifically exclude the folder from paths that get scanned.</li>
						<li>We recommend updating your graphics card drivers before playing if they are not fully up-to-date. Out-of-date drivers can cause performance and stability issues.</li>
						<li>By default, the game will run at your desktop resolution and at max quality settings. If your game is running slowly, you can go to the Options menu on the title screen and lower your resolution. In future builds we are going to work on exposing more performance tweaking options to support lower-end machines.</li>
						<li>Currently, we only support 64-bit Windows machines. If you're on a 32-bit machine, please let us know and we can look into setting up a build for you.</li>
